# Review Code Performance

Guidelines, best practices, and a structured framework for analyzing code for performance bottlenecks including time complexity, memory usage, I/O operations, and scalability issues.

## Performance Analysis Areas

### 1. Time Complexity
- Algorithmic efficiency
- Loop optimization
- Recursion analysis
- Async operation efficiency
- Batch processing opportunities

### 2. Space Complexity
- Memory usage patterns
- Data structure efficiency
- Memory leaks detection
- Object lifecycle management
- Cache effectiveness

### 3. I/O Operations
- Database query optimization
- Network request efficiency
- File I/O optimization
- Batch vs individual operations
- Connection pooling

### 4. Rendering/UI Performance
- DOM manipulation efficiency
- React/vDOM optimization
- Lazy loading opportunities
- Bundle size optimization
- Image/media optimization

### 5. Scalability
- Concurrent request handling
- Resource contention
- Load testing considerations
- Horizontal scaling readiness
- State management efficiency

## When to Apply

Use this framework when:
- Optimizing slow code
- Conducting performance reviews
- Analyzing algorithm efficiency
- Preparing code for scale

## Expected Output

When applying this framework, include:
1. Performance bottlenecks identified
2. Severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Code examples showing problems
4. Optimized code with explanations
5. Performance metrics comparison
6. Further optimization recommendations
