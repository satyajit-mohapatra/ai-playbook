# Analyze Test Coverage

Guidelines, best practices, and a structured framework for analyzing and improving test coverage for codebases including gap identification and prioritization strategies.

## Coverage Analysis Framework

### 1. Coverage Metrics
- Line coverage
- Branch coverage
- Function/method coverage
- Statement coverage
- Condition coverage

### 2. Gap Identification
- Uncovered code paths
- Missing test scenarios
- Edge cases not tested
- Error conditions untested
- Integration gaps

### 3. Prioritization
- Critical path coverage
- Business logic priority
- Risk-based testing
- Feature importance
- Usage frequency

### 4. Testing Strategies
- Unit testing approach
- Integration testing
- E2E testing needs
- Property-based testing
- Mutation testing

### 5. Improvement Plan
- Quick wins
- High-impact additions
- Long-term strategy
- Automation opportunities

## When to Apply

Use this framework when:
- Improving test suites for better coverage
- Analyzing coverage reports for gaps
- Prioritizing test additions
- Setting coverage goals for projects

## Expected Output

When applying this framework, include:
1. Current coverage analysis
2. Gaps identified
3. Prioritized improvement list
4. Test addition recommendations
5. Automation opportunities
6. Monitoring strategy
