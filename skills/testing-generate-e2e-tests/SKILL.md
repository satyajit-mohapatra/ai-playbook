# Generate E2E Tests

Guidelines, best practices, and a structured framework for creating comprehensive end-to-end test scenarios covering user journeys, workflows, and system interactions.

## E2E Testing Framework

### 1. User Journey Mapping
- Critical user paths
- Feature workflows
- Multi-step processes
- Cross-feature interactions

### 2. Test Scenario Design
- Happy path scenarios
- Alternative flows
- Error recovery paths
- Parallel workflows

### 3. Test Data Management
- Test data setup
- Data cleanup strategies
- Environment configuration
- Fixture management

### 4. Assertion Strategy
- UI state assertions
- Data validation
- API response verification
- Database state checks
- Performance assertions

### 5. Test Organization
- Feature-based grouping
- Priority-based ordering
- Dependency management
- Parallel execution

### 6. Best Practices
- Independent tests
- Reliable selectors
- Proper waits
- Debug information
- Screenshot on failure

## When to Apply

Use this framework when:
- Writing integration tests for complete user flows
- Testing critical user journeys
- Setting up E2E test suites for applications
- Planning automated UI testing

## Expected Output

When applying this framework, include:
1. User journey documentation
2. Complete E2E test suite
3. Test data setup/teardown
4. Configuration examples
5. Execution guidelines
6. Maintenance recommendations
