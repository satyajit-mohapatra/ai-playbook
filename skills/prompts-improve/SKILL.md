- Expectation alignment

### 2. Completeness Check
- Missing context
- Incomplete instructions
- Undefined outputs
- Scope gaps

### 3. Effectiveness Optimization
- Instruction ordering
- Priority emphasis
- Example quality
- Constraint relevance

### 4. Edge Case Handling
- Boundary conditions
- Error scenarios
- Alternative paths
- Fallback behavior

### 5. Output Quality
- Format specification
- Detail level
- Structure guidance
- Quality criteria

## When to Apply
