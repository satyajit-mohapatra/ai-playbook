# Apply Design Patterns

Guidelines, best practices, and a structured framework for applying appropriate design patterns to solve common software problems including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.

## Common Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton**: Single instance, global access
- **Factory Method**: Object creation through interfaces
- **Abstract Factory**: Create families of related objects
- **Builder**: Construct complex objects step by step
- **Prototype**: Clone existing objects

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Bridge incompatible interfaces
- **Decorator**: Add behavior dynamically
- **Facade**: Simplified interface to complex subsystem
- **Proxy**: Controlled access to objects
- **Composite**: Treat individual and compositions uniformly

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer**: Notify multiple objects of changes
- **Strategy**: Encapsulate interchangeable algorithms
- **Command**: Encapsulate requests as objects
- **Iterator**: Traverse collections without exposing structure
- **State**: Change behavior with internal state

## Analysis Framework

1. Identify the problem domain
2. List requirements and constraints
3. Evaluate pattern candidates
4. Show pattern implementation with code examples
5. Discuss trade-offs and alternatives

## When to Apply

Use this framework when:
- Refactoring code to improve architecture
- Architecting new solutions
- Solving recurring software design problems
- Teaching design patterns

## Expected Output

When applying this framework, include:
1. Problem analysis
2. Recommended patterns with rationale
3. Class diagrams
4. Code implementations
5. Benefits and trade-offs
