# Compare Technologies

Guidelines, best practices, and a structured framework for comparing and contrasting technical solutions, frameworks, and tools across multiple criteria including performance and ecosystem.

## Comparison Framework

### 1. Core Criteria
- Performance
- Scalability
- Learning curve
- Community support
- Documentation quality
- Maturity and stability

### 2. Technical Comparison
- Architecture patterns
- Language/ecosystem fit
- Integration capabilities
- Extensibility
- Tooling support

### 3. Use Case Fit
- Best suited scenarios
- Strengths in specific contexts
- Weaknesses and limitations
- Trade-offs to consider

### 4. Operational Aspects
- Deployment complexity
- Monitoring and observability
- Debugging capabilities
- Cost considerations
- Vendor lock-in

### 5. Ecosystem
- Available libraries/packages
- Third-party integrations
- Plugins and extensions
- Template/starter projects
- Learning resources

## When to Apply

Use this framework when:
- Evaluating technology choices for projects
- Making architectural decisions
- Comparing frameworks or libraries
- Researching alternatives for existing tech stack

## Expected Output

When applying this framework, include:
1. Side-by-side comparison table
2. Detailed analysis of each criterion
3. Recommendation matrix
4. Use case recommendations
5. Decision tree or flow chart
6. Resources for deeper learning
