# System Design

Guidelines, best practices, and a structured framework for designing scalable, reliable distributed systems with proper architecture, data management, and scalability strategies.

## Design Framework

### 1. Requirements Clarification
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements (scalability, reliability, latency)
- Constraints and assumptions

### 2. High-Level Architecture
- Identify major components
- Define component responsibilities
- Plan for loose coupling
- Consider microservices vs monolith

### 3. Data Management
- Choose data storage types (relational, NoSQL, cache)
- Design data flow and consistency models
- Plan for data partitioning and replication
- Consider backup and recovery strategies

### 4. Scalability & Reliability
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Plan for load balancing
- Implement redundancy and failover
- Consider circuit breakers and bulkheads

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Identify bottlenecks
- Plan for caching strategies
- Consider asynchronous processing
- Design for graceful degradation

## When to Apply

Use this framework when:
- Planning large-scale system architecture
- Designing distributed applications
- Preparing for system design interviews
- Evaluating scalability requirements
- Architecting microservices or cloud systems

## Expected Output

When applying this framework, include:
1. Requirements summary
2. Architecture diagram (text-based)
3. Component breakdown
4. Data model
5. Scalability strategy
6. Reliability measures
7. Trade-offs discussion
