# Conduct Code Reviews

A systematic framework for conducting thorough code reviews that ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. Code Style & Readability
- Language/framework conventions
- Naming clarity and consistency
- Self-documenting code
- Comment quality and relevance
- Formatting consistency

### 2. Code Organization
- Proper modularization
- Separation of concerns
- Single-purpose functions
- Logical file structure
- DRY principle compliance

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful error handling
- Helpful error messages
- Proper logging
- Edge case consideration
- Defensive programming

### 4. Testing & Testability
- Code testability
- Dependency injection
- Side effect isolation
- Test coverage adequacy
- Test meaningfulness

### 5. Maintainability
- Ease of modification
- Technical debt awareness
- Magic numbers/strings avoidance
- Configuration externalization
- Documentation adequacy

### 6. SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility
- Open/Closed principle
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

## When to Apply

Use this framework when:
- Reviewing pull requests
- Conducting code audits
- Mentoring junior developers
- Establishing team coding standards
- Refactoring legacy code

## Expected Output

A comprehensive code review should provide:
1. Critical Issues (must-fix before merge)
2. High Priority improvements (address soon)
3. Medium Priority recommendations (nice to have)
4. Low Priority enhancements (future consideration)
5. Code examples showing improved versions
6. Educational context for each finding
