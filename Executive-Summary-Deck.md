# Slide 3: What is AI-First Engineering?

## A New Operating Model for Development

```
TRADITIONAL                          AI-FIRST
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                     
Developer writes all code    →    AI drafts, developer refines
                                     
Manual code review           →    AI pre-review + focused human review
                                     
Test writing is tedious      →    AI generates test scaffolds
                                     
Documentation outdated       →    Auto-generated from code
                                     
Bugs found in production     →    AI-powered quality gates catch earlier
```

### Key Principle: Augmentation, Not Replacement

> Engineers focus on **creative problem-solving** while AI handles **repetitive implementation tasks**

# Slide 5: Implementation Timeline

## 12-Month Phased Approach

```
PHASE 1                 PHASE 2                 PHASE 3
Foundation              Expansion               Optimization
Months 1-3              Months 4-6              Months 7-12
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

┌───────────────┐      ┌───────────────┐      ┌───────────────┐
│ • Pilot teams │      │ • Full rollout│      │ • Advanced AI │
│ • Tool setup  │  →   │ • Integration │  →   │ • Optimization│
│ • Training    │      │ • Champions   │      │ • Scaling     │
└───────────────┘      └───────────────┘      └───────────────┘

     2-3 teams              All teams          Full automation
     Validate Quality       Build muscle       Maximize value
```

### Risk-Managed Approach
- Phase 1 validates assumptions before scaling
- Clear exit criteria between phases
- Flexibility to adjust based on learnings

# Slide 6: Security & Compliance

## Enterprise-Ready from Day One

### Security Controls

| Layer | Protection |
|-------|------------|
| **Input** | No PII, no secrets, no proprietary IP in prompts |
| **Processing** | Enterprise-tier vendors only (SOC 2 certified) |
| **Output** | Automated security scanning + human review |
| **Runtime** | Audit logging + incident response playbooks |

### Ed-Tech Compliance

| Regulation | Our Approach |
|------------|--------------|
| **FERPA** | AI tools never process student data |
| **COPPA** | Content generation guidelines enforced |
| **WCAG** | Accessibility checks on all AI-generated UI |

### Governance Structure
- Steering Committee (quarterly) - CTO, CISO, Legal
- Working Group (monthly) - Day-to-day oversight
- Champions (weekly) - Peer support & standards

# Slide 8: Risk Mitigation

## Addressing Key Concerns

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **"AI code is insecure"** | Mandatory security scans + human review on all paths |
| **"Our code could leak"** | Enterprise tools only; no training on our data; legal DPAs |
| **"Engineers will resist"** | Champion program; protected learning time; demonstrate value |
| **"Skills will atrophy"** | Maintain coding practices; code review depth requirements |
| **"Vendor lock-in"** | Multi-tool strategy; abstraction layers |

### Safety Nets
- Phased rollout validates before scaling
- Rollback procedures for each phase
- Opt-out rights for engineers who prefer traditional methods
